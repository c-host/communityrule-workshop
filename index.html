            <h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
            <p>A 2-hour hands-on workshop exploring how groups can use digital tools to create clear rules for
                self-governing their communities. Governance is how groups make choices and organize themselves - like a
                recipe that helps everyone work together effectively.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>By the end of the workshop, participants will have learned how to create and publish an example
                    community governance structure with CommunityRule that they can use and adapt for their community
                    projects.</strong>

                        <h3>Making Hidden Hierarchies Visible</h3>
                        <div class="quote">
                            For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate in
                            its activities the structure must be explicit, not implicit. The rules of decision-making
                            must be open and available to everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized.
                            <div class="author">— Jo Freeman, "The Tyranny of Structurelessness"</div>
                        </div>

                        <h3>The Problem with "Structureless" Groups</h3>
                        <p>Groups that claim to be "structureless" often create hidden hierarchies through informal
                            friendship networks, making power invisible and excluding some members from decision-making.
                        </p>

                        <div class="quote">
                            There is no such thing as a structureless group. Any group of people of whatever nature that
                            comes together for any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in
                            some fashion.

                        <h3>The Approach: Democratic Structuring</h3>
                        <p>Democratic structuring with explicit rules, roles, and decision-making processes ensures that
                            everyone can participate meaningfully.</p>

                        <h3>Jo Freeman's Seven Principles of Democratic Structuring</h3>
                        <div class="quote">
                            Once the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of 'structurelessness,' it is
                            free to develop those forms of organization best suited to its healthy functioning. This
                            does not mean that we should go to the other extreme and blindly imitate the traditional
                            forms of organization. But neither should we blindly reject them all. Some of the
                            traditional techniques will prove useful, albeit not perfect; some will give us insights
                            into what we should and should not do to obtain certain ends with minimal costs to the
                            individuals in the movement. Mostly, we will have to experiment with different kinds of
                            structuring and develop a variety of techniques to use for different situations. [...]
                            before we can proceed to experiment intelligently, we must accept the idea that there is
                            nothing inherently bad about structure itself -- only its excess use.

                            <h4>Note:</h4>
                            <p>Even organizations that explicitly aim to be non-hierarchical, like
                                Teal organizations, Holacracy, or those using flat ontology, still have clear structures
                                and processes.</p>
                            <h4>For Example</h4>
                            <li><strong>Teal organizations</strong> use self-managing teams with defined roles and
                                decision-making protocols.</li>
                            <li><strong>Holacracy</strong> replaces traditional hierarchies with "circles" that have
                                explicit governance rules.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flat ontologies</strong> still require coordination mechanisms and ways to
                                distribute responsibility.</li>
                            <br>
                            These approaches don't eliminate structure - they reimagine it to be more democratic and
                            participatory while maintaining clarity and accountability.
